## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Sticky Image Scrollytelling:** As users scroll through a project, images lock into place while the narrative text scrolls past, creating an immersive, guided tour experience similar to a physical gallery.
*   **Interactive Lightbox:** All gallery images can be opened in a beautiful, full-screen lightbox with keyboard navigation, captions, thumbnails, and zoom capabilities, powered by `yet-another-react-lightbox`.
*   **Infinite Logo Marquee:** An elegant, seamless, and infinitely scrolling marquee displays client and press logos for social proof, built with pure CSS animations.
*   **Smooth Scroll:** Silky-smooth, performant scrolling implemented with `@studio-freight/lenis` for a premium feel.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures the site is stunning and functional on all devices, from phones to desktops.
*   **SEO Optimized:** Comes with automatically generated `sitemap.xml` and a `robots.txt` file to ensure proper indexing by search engines.
*   **Python Content Manager:** Includes a powerful helper script to automate the tedious process of resizing images and generating the required TypeScript code for new projects.
